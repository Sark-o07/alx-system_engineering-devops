## OSI Model

In this section, you will learn about the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. Understanding the OSI model is essential for grasping how network protocols and communication work.

---

## Types of Network

This section explores different types of networks, such as LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and MAN (Metropolitan Area Network). It delves into the characteristics and use cases of each type of network, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of network infrastructure.

---

## MAC and IP Address

MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are fundamental components of network communication. This section will explain the roles of MAC and IP addresses, their formats, and how they are used in data transmission across networks.

---

## UDP and TCP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are two primary transport layer protocols used in networking. You will learn the key differences between UDP and TCP, their strengths and weaknesses, and when to use each of them for different types of applications.

---

## TCP and UDP Ports

Ports are crucial for directing network traffic to specific services or applications running on a device. This section will cover how TCP and UDP ports function, common port numbers, and how to effectively manage ports for your networking needs.

---

## Is the Host on the Network

Determining whether a host is active on a network is essential for troubleshooting and network administration. In this section, you will explore various methods and tools used to check the availability and status of hosts within a network.

## 1. Install nginx web server

### Mandatory

Readme:

- Nginx should be listening on port 80
- When querying Nginx at its root `/` with a GET request (requesting a page) using `curl`, it must return a page that contains the string `Hello World!`
- As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect the above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
- You can’t use `systemctl` for restarting nginx
- Server terminal:

```bash
$ ./1-install_nginx_web_server
```
